# Setting up cloud projects and accounts

## Creating projects

Any GCP resources that you allocate and use must belong to a project. You can think of a project as the organizing entity for what you're building. A project is made up of the settings, permissions, and other metadata that describe your applications. Resources within a single project can work together easily, for example by communicating through an internal network, subject to the regions-and-zones rules. The resources that each project contains remain separate across project boundaries; you can only interconnect them through an external network connection.

Each GCP project has:

* A project name, which you provide
* A project ID, which you can provide or GCP can provide for you.
* A project number, which GCP provides

As you work with GCP, you'll use these identifiers in certain command lines and API calls. The following screenshot shows a project name, its ID, and number:

![console ids](https://cloud.google.com/docs/images/overview/console-ids.png)

In this example:

* `Example project` is the project name.
* `example-id` is the project ID.
* `123456789012` is the project number.

Each project ID (`example-id`) is unique across GCP. Once you have created a project, you can delete the project but its ID can never be used again.

When billing is enabled, each project is associated with one billing account. Multiple projects can have their resource usage billed to the same account.

A project serves as a namespace. This means every resource within each project must have a unique name, but you can usually reuse resource names if they are in separate projects. Some resource names must be globally unique. Refer to the documentation for the resource for details.

To create a project, you must have the `resourcemanager.projects.create` permission. When an organization is created, the entire domain has the Project Creator role, which includes that permission. For information on how to grant individuals the Project Creator role and limit organization-wide access, see the [Managing Default Organization Roles](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/default-access-control) page.

To create a new project through the console:

1. Go to the GCP Console [Manage resources](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-resource-manager) page.
2. On the drop-down at the top of the page, select the organization in which you want to create a project.
3. Click **Create Project**
4. In the **New Project** window that appears, enter a project name and select a billing account as applicable.
5. If you want to add the project to a folder, enter the folder name in the **Location** box.
6. When you're finished entering new project details, click **Create**.
